# NTRIP Atlas Licensing

NTRIP Atlas uses **dual licensing** to maximize freedom and usability while ensuring the broadest possible adoption.

## Licensing Structure

### 📚 **Service Database**: CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)

All NTRIP service data in the `data/` directory is released under **Creative Commons Zero (CC0)**.

**What this means:**
- ✅ **No attribution required** - use freely without crediting us
- ✅ **Commercial use unlimited** - incorporate into commercial products
- ✅ **Modify and redistribute** - create derivative databases
- ✅ **No restrictions** - essentially public domain worldwide

**File**: `LICENSE-DATA`

### 💻 **C Library Code**: MIT License

The C library implementation in `libntripatlas/` is released under **MIT License**.

**What this means:**
- ✅ **Very permissive** - modify and redistribute freely
- ✅ **Commercial use allowed** - use in proprietary products
- ✅ **Minimal requirements** - only retain copyright notice
- ✅ **No copyleft** - no requirement to open-source derivatives

**File**: `LICENSE-CODE`

## Why This Approach?

### **Maximum Data Freedom**
We want NTRIP service information to be **universally accessible** without any barriers:
- Government agencies can incorporate without legal review
- Commercial GPS manufacturers can embed without attribution
- Open source projects can use without license compatibility issues
- Academic researchers can publish without licensing concerns

### **Encourage Ecosystem Growth**
By making data completely free:
- Competing libraries can use the same high-quality database
- Service providers benefit from accurate representation
- Users benefit from consistent service discovery across tools
- Innovation happens faster with shared infrastructure

### **Legal Clarity**
Two separate licenses eliminate confusion:
- **Data users** know they have zero obligations
- **Code users** have clear, well-understood MIT terms
- **Contributors** understand their rights are preserved

## For Contributors

### **Data Contributions** (Service Information)
By contributing service data, you agree to release it under **CC0 Public Domain**:
- Your contribution becomes freely usable by anyone
- No attribution to you is required (though appreciated!)
- Commercial use is explicitly allowed
- You cannot later revoke these permissions

### **Code Contributions** (Library Implementation)
By contributing code, you agree to license it under **MIT License**:
- Your code can be used in proprietary applications
- Attribution to the project (not you specifically) is required
- You retain copyright to your contributions
- Commercial use is allowed with attribution

## Usage Examples

### ✅ **Completely Free Uses**
```
"We embedded the NTRIP Atlas service database in our commercial
 GPS receiver without attribution or payment."

"Our government mapping agency uses NTRIP Atlas data to improve
 national positioning services."

"We created a competing library using the same service database
 but with different algorithms."
```

### ✅ **Code Usage Requirements**
```
"Our product uses the NTRIP Atlas C library. We include this
 notice in our documentation:

 Contains NTRIP Atlas library code - Copyright (c) 2024 NTRIP Atlas Contributors
 Licensed under MIT License."
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use NTRIP Atlas in a commercial product?**
A: Yes, both the data (CC0) and code (MIT) allow commercial use.

**Q: Do I need to credit NTRIP Atlas when using the service database?**
A: No attribution is required for the data, though it's appreciated.

**Q: Can I create a competing library using this data?**
A: Absolutely! The data is public domain for exactly this purpose.

**Q: What if I only use the service data, not the code?**
A: No license obligations at all - the data is public domain.

**Q: Can I contribute service data and later remove it?**
A: No, CC0 contributions cannot be revoked once made.

**Q: What about patent issues?**
A: CC0 and MIT explicitly address patent concerns - you're protected.
